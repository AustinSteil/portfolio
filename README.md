# Portfolio Website for Austin Steil

## Project Purpose

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my unique, interdisciplinary professional background and talents as an Occupational Health Systems Expert. The goal is to present a comprehensive, web-based resume that balances healthcare, business, and technology experience — not as a traditional software engineering portfolio, but as an executive overview of my capabilities across multiple industries.

This portfolio functions as an interactive online resume that highlights the following professional areas:

* Business Strategy & Operations
* Healthcare Technology
* Clinical Care Experience
* Workplace Health & Safety
* People & Program Leadership

Each section represents a facet of my career journey, with clear messaging around transferable skills, past experiences, and potential value in various professional opportunities.
