# Professional Portfolio Website for Austin Steil

## Project Purpose

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase the unique, interdisciplinary professional background and talents of \[Your Name].

* Business
* Technology
* Clinical Care
* Safety Professional
* Leadership

Each section represents a facet of \[Your Name]'s career journey, with clear messaging around transferable skills, past experiences, and potential value in various professional opportunities.
